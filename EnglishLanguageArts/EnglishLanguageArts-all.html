The curriculum focuses on analyzing how literary devices such as suspense, foreshadowing, and the uncanny are translated into cinematic techniques like lighting, sound design, and camera angles. By examining recurring themes of the monstrous, the unknown, and the forbidden, students will critically analyze how horror serves as a powerful medium for exploring the darker side of human nature and society.</p>

              <p>This course analyzes rock and roll (along with its related genres like folk, punk, and hip-hop) as a vital form of 20th and 21st-century literature. Moving beyond the music, students will treat lyrics as poetry, examining the work of influential singer-songwriters—from Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell to Kendrick Lamar—as contemporary authors. The class will apply formal literary analysis to explore narrative structure in songs and concept albums, the use of poetic devices like metaphor and allusion, and the evolution of major themes such as rebellion, alienation, love, and social protest. By placing these "texts" within their historical and cultural contexts, this course validates popular music as a powerful and legitimate medium for storytelling.</p>
